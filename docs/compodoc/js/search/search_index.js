Use sparingly and consider these alternatives:\n\nPreferred: Filter in component using computed signals or methods\nAlternative: Use *ngFor with trackBy and filter in component\nAcceptable: Use this pipe for small arrays or infrequent filtering\n\nExample :// ✅ PREFERRED: Filter in component with computed signal\nfilteredItems = computed(() => {\n  return this.items().filter(item => item.active);\n});\n\n// ❌ AVOID: Impure pipe runs on every change detection\nUsage\nWith Predicate Function\nExample :\n  {{ item.name }}\nExample :@Component({\n  template: `...`,\n  imports: [FilterPipe, CommonModule]\n})\nexport class MyComponent {\n  items = [\n    { name: 'Item 1', active: true },\n    { name: 'Item 2', active: false },\n  ];\n\n  isActive = (item: any) => item.active;\n}With Property Matching\nExample :\n  {{ user.name }}\nWith Search Text\nExample :\n\n  {{ item.name }}\nType Safety\nExample :interface User {\n  name: string;\n  active: boolean;\n}\n\n// Type-safe predicate\nfilterActive = (user: User) => user.active;\n\n// In template\nExamples\nExample :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNull/Undefined Handling\nReturns empty array for null/undefined:\nExample :\n\nBest Practices\n✅ DO: Use for small, static arrays\nExample :const categories = ['all', 'active', 'archived'];\nfilteredCategories = categories.filter(...);✅ DO: Combine with trackBy for better performance\nExample :❌ AVOID: Large arrays or frequent updates\nExample :\n❌ AVOID: Complex filtering logic in templates\nExample :\nAlternative: Filter in Component\nFor better performance, filter in your component:\nExample :@Component({\n  template: `\n    \n      {{ item.name }}\n    \n  `\n})\nexport class MyComponent {\n  items = signal([...]);\n  searchTerm =

* FilterPipe\n *\n * Filters an array based on a predicate function or property matching.\n *\n * ## Features\n * - **IMPURE PIPE**: Runs on every change detection cycle to detect array mutations\n * - Supports custom predicate functions for flexible filtering\n * - Supports simple property-value matching\n * - Type-safe with strict TypeScript\n * - Handles null/undefined gracefully\n * - Returns empty array for invalid inputs\n *\n * ## ⚠️ Performance Warning\n *\n * This is an **impure pipe** (pure: false), meaning it runs on every change detection\n * cycle. Use sparingly and consider these alternatives:\n *\n * - **Preferred**: Filter in component using computed signals or methods\n * - **Alternative**: Use *ngFor with trackBy and filter in component\n * - **Acceptable**: Use this pipe for small arrays or infrequent filtering\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // ✅ PREFERRED: Filter in component with computed signal\n * filteredItems = computed(() => {\n *   return this.items().filter(item => item.active);\n * });\n *\n * // ❌ AVOID: Impure pipe runs on every change detection\n * \n * ```\n *\n * ## Usage\n *\n * ### With Predicate Function\n * ```html\n * \n *   {{ item.name }}\n * \n * ```\n *\n * ```typescript\n * @Component({\n *   template: `...`,\n *   imports: [FilterPipe, CommonModule]\n * })\n * export class MyComponent {\n *   items = [\n *     { name: 'Item 1', active: true },\n *     { name: 'Item 2', active: false },\n *   ];\n *\n *   isActive = (item: any) => item.active;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * ### With Property Matching\n * ```html\n * \n *   {{ user.name }}\n * \n * ```\n *\n * ### With Search Text\n * ```html\n * \n * \n *   {{ item.name }}\n * \n * ```\n *\n * ## Type Safety\n *\n * ```typescript\n * interface User {\n *   name: string;\n *   active: boolean;\n * }\n *\n * // Type-safe predicate\n * filterActive = (user: User) => user.active;\n *\n * // In template\n * \n * ```\n *\n * ## Examples\n *\n * ```html\n * \n * \n *\n * \n * \n *\n * \n * \n *\n * \n * \n * \n * ```\n *\n * ## Null/Undefined Handling\n *\n * Returns empty array for null/undefined:\n *\n * ```html\n * \n * \n * \n * ```\n *\n * ## Best Practices\n *\n * ### ✅ DO: Use for small, static arrays\n * ```typescript\n * const categories = ['all', 'active', 'archived'];\n * filteredCategories = categories.filter(...);\n * ```\n *\n * ### ✅ DO: Combine with trackBy for better performance\n * ```html\n * \n * ```\n *\n * ### ❌ AVOID: Large arrays or frequent updates\n * ```html\n * \n * \n * ```\n *\n * ### ❌ AVOID: Complex filtering logic in templates\n * ```html\n * \n * \n * ```\n *\n * ## Alternative: Filter in Component\n *\n * For better performance, filter in your component:\n *\n * ```typescript\n * @Component({\n *   template: `\n *     \n *       {{ item.name }}\n *     \n *   `\n * })\n * export class MyComponent {\n *   items = signal([...]);\n *   searchTerm = signal('');\n *\n *   filteredItems = computed(() => {\n *     const term = this.searchTerm().toLowerCase();\n *     return this.items().filter(item =>\n *       item.name.toLowerCase().includes(term)\n *     );\n *   });\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * @see

              HighlightPipe\nHighlights search terms in text by wrapping them in  tags.\nFeatures\n\nPure pipe for performance (caches result for same input)\nCase-insensitive highlighting by default\nUses  HTML tag for semantic highlighting\nReturns SafeHtml for secure rendering\nType-safe with strict TypeScript\nHandles null/undefined gracefully\nEscapes HTML in input text to prevent XSS\n\nUsage\nBasic Usage\nExample :\n\nsearch term example\" -->Case Sensitive\nExample :\nIn Component\nExample :@Component({\n  template: `\n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n  `,\n  imports: [HighlightPipe, FormsModule, CommonModule]\n})\nexport class SearchResultsComponent {\n  searchTerm = '';\n  items = [\n    { title: 'Angular Tutorial' },\n    { title: 'TypeScript Guide' },\n  ];\n}Styling\nStyle the highlighted text using CSS:\nExample :mark {\n  background-color: yellow;\n  color: black;\n  padding: 0 2px;\n  border-radius: 2px;\n}Examples\nExample :\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNull/Undefined Handling\nReturns empty string for null/undefined text or search term:\nExample :\n\n\n\nSecurity\nThe pipe automatically escapes HTML in the input text to prevent XSS attacks,\nthen safely applies  tags for highlighting. The result is sanitized\nusing Angular's DomSanitizer.\nExample :\nPerformance Notes\n\nPure pipe: Result is cached when inputs don't change\nRegex-based matching for efficient highlighting\nCase-insensitive by default (can impact performance on very long strings)\n\nSee https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/mark\n\n            \n\n\n        \n

input)\n * - Case-insensitive highlighting by default\n * - Uses  HTML tag for semantic highlighting\n * - Returns SafeHtml for secure rendering\n * - Type-safe with strict TypeScript\n * - Handles null/undefined gracefully\n * - Escapes HTML in input text to prevent XSS\n *\n * ## Usage\n *\n * ### Basic Usage\n * ```html\n * \n * \n * search term example\" -->\n * ```\n *\n * ### Case Sensitive\n * ```html\n * \n * \n * ```\n *\n * ### In Component\n * ```typescript\n * @Component({\n *   template: `\n *     \n *     \n *       \n *         \n *       \n *     \n *   `,\n *   imports: [HighlightPipe, FormsModule, CommonModule]\n * })\n * export class SearchResultsComponent {\n *   searchTerm = '';\n *   items = [\n *     { title: 'Angular Tutorial' },\n *     { title: 'TypeScript Guide' },\n *   ];\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * ## Styling\n *\n * Style the highlighted text using CSS:\n *\n * ```css\n * mark {\n *   background-color: yellow;\n *   color: black;\n *   padding: 0 2px;\n *   border-radius: 2px;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * ## Examples\n *\n * ```html\n * \n * \n *\n * \n * \n *\n * \n * \n * ```\n *\n * ## Null/Undefined Handling\n *\n * Returns empty string for null/undefined text or search term:\n *\n * ```html\n * \n * \n *\n * \n * \n * ```\n *\n * ## Security\n *\n * The pipe automatically escapes HTML in the input text to prevent XSS attacks,\n * then safely applies  tags for highlighting. The result is sanitized\n * using Angular's DomSanitizer.\n *\n * ```html\n * \n * \n * ```\n *\n * ## Performance Notes\n *\n * - Pure pipe: Result is cached when inputs don't change\n * - Regex-based matching for efficient highlighting\n * - Case-insensitive by default (can impact performance on very long strings)\n *\n * @see {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/mark}\n */\n@Pipe({\n  name: 'highlight',\n  standalone: true,\n  pure: true,\n})\nexport class HighlightPipe implements PipeTransform {\n  private sanitizer = inject(DomSanitizer);\n  private document = inject(DOCUMENT);\n\n  /**\n   * Highlights search terms in text by wrapping them in  tags.\n   *\n   * @param value - The text to search and highlight\n   * @param searchTerm - The term to highlight\n   * @param caseSensitive - Whether to match case (default: false)\n   * @returns SafeHtml with highlighted terms or empty string for null/undefined\n   *\n   * @example\n   * ```typescript\n   * // In template\n   * \n   * \n   * ```\n   */\n  transform(\n    value: string | null | undefined,\n    searchTerm: string | null | undefined,\n    caseSensitive = false\n  ): SafeHtml | string {\n    if (!value) {\n      return '';\n    }\n\n    if (!searchTerm || searchTerm.trim() === '') {\n      // No search term, return escaped text\n      return this.escapeHtml(value);\n    }\n\n    // Escape HTML in input text to prevent XSS\n    const escapedValue = this.escapeHtml(value);\n\n    // Escape special regex characters in search term\n    const escapedSearchTerm = searchTerm.replace(/[.*+?^${}()|[\\]\\\\]/g, '\\\\$&');\n\n    // Create regex with appropriate flags\n    const flags = caseSensitive ?

a.name.localeCompare(b.name));\n});\n\n// ❌ AVOID: Impure pipe runs on every change detection\nUsage\nSort by Property (Ascending)\nExample :\n  {{ user.name }}\nSort by Property (Descending)\nExample :\n  {{ user.name }}\nSort with Custom Comparator\nExample :\n  {{ item.title }}\nExample :@Component({\n  template: `...`,\n  imports: [SortPipe, CommonModule]\n})\nexport class MyComponent {\n

Practices\n✅ DO: Use for small, static arrays\nExample :const categories = ['zebra', 'apple', 'banana'];\nsortedCategories = categories.sort();✅ DO: Combine with trackBy for better performance\nExample :❌ AVOID: Large arrays or frequent updates\nExample :\n❌ AVOID: Complex sorting logic in templates\nExample :\nAlternative: Sort in Component\nFor better performance, sort in your

using a custom comparator function.\n *\n * ## Features\n * - **IMPURE PIPE**: Runs on every change detection cycle to detect array mutations\n * - Supports ascending and descending sort\n * - Supports sorting by property name\n * - Supports custom comparator functions\n * - Type-safe with strict TypeScript\n * - Handles null/undefined gracefully\n * - Returns empty array for invalid inputs\n *\n * ## ⚠️ Performance Warning\n *\n * This is an **impure pipe** (pure: false), meaning it runs on every change detection\n * cycle. Use sparingly and consider these alternatives:\n *\n * - **Preferred**: Sort in component using computed signals or methods\n * - **Alternative**: Use *ngFor with trackBy and sort in component\n * - **Acceptable**: Use this pipe for small arrays or infrequent sorting\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // ✅ PREFERRED: Sort in component with computed signal\n * sortedItems = computed(() => {\n *   return [...this.items()].sort((a, b) => a.name.localeCompare(b.name));\n * });\n *\n * // ❌ AVOID: Impure pipe runs on every change detection\n * \n * ```\n *\n * ## Usage\n *\n * ### Sort by Property (Ascending)\n * ```html\n * \n *   {{ user.name }}\n * \n * ```\n *\n * ### Sort by Property (Descending)\n * ```html\n * \n *   {{ user.name }}\n * \n * ```\n *\n * ### Sort with Custom Comparator\n * ```html\n * \n *   {{ item.title }}\n * \n * ```\n *\n * ```typescript\n * @Component({\n *   template: `...`,\n *   imports: [SortPipe, CommonModule]\n * })\n * export class MyComponent {\n *   items = [\n *     { title: 'B', priority: 1 },\n *     { title: 'A', priority: 2 },\n *   ];\n *\n *   customComparator = (a: any, b: any) => a.priority - b.priority;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * ## Type Safety\n *\n * ```typescript\n * interface User {\n *   name: string;\n *   age: number;\n * }\n *\n * // Type-safe comparator\n * sortByAge = (a: User, b: User) => a.age - b.age;\n *\n * // In template\n * \n * ```\n *\n * ## Examples\n *\n * ```html\n * \n * \n *\n * \n * \n *\n * \n * \n *\n * \n * \n * ```\n *\n * ## Null/Undefined Handling\n *\n * Returns empty array for null/undefined:\n *\n * ```html\n * \n * \n * \n * ```\n *\n * Null/undefined property values are sorted to the end:\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // Items with null 'name' will appear at the end\n * {{ items | sort:'name' }}\n * ```\n *\n * ## Best Practices\n *\n * ### ✅ DO: Use for small, static arrays\n * ```typescript\n * const categories = ['zebra', 'apple', 'banana'];\n * sortedCategories = categories.sort();\n * ```\n *\n * ### ✅ DO: Combine with trackBy for better performance\n * ```html\n * \n * ```\n *\n * ### ❌ AVOID: Large arrays or frequent updates\n * ```html\n * \n * \n * ```\n *\n * ### ❌ AVOID: Complex sorting logic in templates\n * ```html\n * \n * \n * ```\n *\n * ## Alternative: Sort in Component\n *\n * For better performance, sort in your component:\n *\n * ```typescript\n * @Component({\n *   template: `\n *     \n *       {{ item.name }}\n *     \n *   `\n * })\n * export class MyComponent {\n *   items = signal([...]);\n *   sortBy = signal('name');\n *\n *   sortedItems = computed(() => {\n *     const items = [...this.items()];\n *     const key = this.sortBy();\n *     return items.sort((a, b) => {\n *       if (a[key]  b[key]) return 1;\n *       return 0;\n *     });\n *   });\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * @see {@link https://angular.dev/guide/pipes}\n */\n@Pipe({\n  name: 'sort',\n  standalone: true,\n  pure: false, // Impure pipe to detect array

A demonstration of scalable architecture, custom design systems, and high-performance UI patterns.\n\n🚀 Features\n\n✅ Modern Angular 21+ with standalone components\n✅ NgRx SignalStore for reactive state management\n✅ Signals for reactive data flow\n✅ Feature-based architecture (Core, Shared, Features)\n✅ Lazy-loaded routes for optimal performance\n✅ OnPush change detection throughout\n✅ Custom design system with CSS Variables (no UI frameworks)\n✅ BEM methodology for maintainable styles\n✅ Responsive layout with mobile-first approach\n✅ Dark mode support (auto-detects system preference)\n✅ Mockend data layer with simulated network latency for realistic development\n✅ Complete CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions (build, test, E2E, performance, security)\n🚧 Client-side AI Career Chatbot with WebLLM and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) - Coming in Phase 5\n\nMoodyJW Portfolio\nA concise developer-focused overview and local quick-start for the MoodyJW portfolio.\nQuick links:\n\nArchitecture: ARCHITECTURE.md\nMock data & services: src/app/core/MOCKEND_GUIDE.md\nStore + integration: src/app/core/STORE_SERVICE_INTEGRATION.md\nGenerated API docs: docs/compodoc/ (generated with Compodoc)\n\nPrerequisites\n\nNode.js (v20 or v22 recommended)\nnpm (use --legacy-peer-deps when adding packages if necessary)\n\nLocal quick start\nExample :# install\nnpm install\n\n# development server\nnpm start\n\n# build production\nnpm run build\n\n# generate docs locally\nnpx compodoc -p tsconfig.json -d docs/compodoc\n# serve docs\nnpx compodoc -s -d docs/compodocWhere things live\n\nApp source: src/app\nMock data: src/assets/data\nGenerated docs: docs/compodoc\nGitHub Actions workflows: .github/workflows\n\nDocs and CI\n\nCompodoc is run locally via npx compodoc and is included in CI (.github/workflows/compodoc.yml).\nThe Pages deploy workflow copies generated Compodoc output into the site so docs are available at /docs/compodoc/ on the deployed site.\n\nContributing\n\nRun npm run lint and npm test before opening PRs.\nSee IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md for phase-level goals and progress.\n\nLicense and security\n\nDo not commit secrets; use GitHub Secrets for tokens.\nCodeQL and dependency review workflows are configured in CI.\n\nExample :import { Component, inject, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\nimport { ProjectStore } from '@core/store';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-case-studies',\n  standalone: true,\n  template: `\n    @if (store.isLoading()) {\n    Loading projects...\n    } @else if (store.error()) {\n    Error: {{ store.error() }}\n    } @else {\n    Projects ({{ store.projectCount() }})\n    @for (project of store.projects(); track project.id) {\n    {{ project.title }}\n    } }\n  `,\n})\nexport class CaseStudiesComponent implements OnInit {\n  readonly store = inject(ProjectStore);\n\n  ngOnInit() {\n    // Load projects automatically triggers loading state\n    this.store.loadProjects();\n  }\n}🤖 Client-Side AI Career Chatbot (Planned - Phase 5)\nThis portfolio will feature an innovative client-side AI chatbot that answers questions about Jay's career, experience, and technical expertise—all running locally in your browser with no backend required.\nArchitecture Overview\nTechnology Stack:\n\nWebLLM: Browser-based LLM inference using Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (quantized)\nRAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Vector search using pre-computed embeddings\nSentence Transformers: Build-time embedding generation with all-MiniLM-L6-v2\nPure TypeScript: Client-side vector similarity search (cosine similarity)\nIndexedDB: Model caching to avoid re-downloading\n\nKey Features\n\n🧠 Fully Client-Side: All AI processing happens in your browser\n⚡ Fast Response Time: Model loads in \n🔒 Privacy-First: No data sent to external servers\n📚 Knowledge Base: Answers questions about career history, projects, skills, and achievements\n♿ Accessible: WCAG 2.1 AAA compliant with keyboard navigation and screen reader support\n📱 Mobile-Friendly: Responsive chat interface works on all devices\n\nHow It Works\n\nBuild Time: Python script generates embeddings from career content corpus\nFirst Load: WebLLM model downloads and caches in IndexedDB (~1-2GB)\nUser Query: Question is embedded and similar content chunks are retrieved via RAG\nResponse: LLM generates contextual answer using only retrieved career information\nStreaming: Tokens stream in real-time for smooth UX\n\nExample Queries\n\n\"What experience does Jay have with Angular?\"\n\"Tell me about Jay's leadership experience\"\n\"What are Jay's most significant technical achievements?\"\n\"Has Jay worked with microservices architecture?\"\n\nStatus: Implementation planned for Phase 5 (see IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)\n🎯 State Management with NgRx SignalStore\nStore Features\nThe ProjectStore provides a complete state management solution:\nState Properties:\n\nprojects() - Array of all projects\nselectedProject() - Currently selected project\nisLoading() - Loading state indicator\nerror() - Error message if any\n\nComputed Selectors:\n\nprojectCount() - Total number of projects\nprojectsByTag(tag) - Filter projects by tag\nhasSelection() - Check if a project is selected\nallTags() - Get all unique tags sorted\n\nMethods:\n\nloadProjects() - Load all projects\nloadProjectById(id) - Load and select specific project\nselectProject(project) - Manually set selected project\nclearSelection() - Clear selected project\nclearError() - Clear error state\nreset() - Reset store to initial state\n\nAdvanced Usage\nExample :// Filter projects by technology\nconst angularProjects = store.projectsByTag()('Angular');\n\n// Check loading state\nif (store.isLoading()) {\n  // Show spinner\n}\n\n// Access all tags for filtering UI\nconst tags = store.allTags(); // ['Angular', 'React', 'TypeScript', ...]🚦 Getting Started\nPrerequisites\n\nNode.js 20.x or higher\nnpm 10.x or higher\n\nInstallation\nExample :# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/MoodyJW/moodyjw-portfolio.git\n\n# Navigate to project directory\ncd moodyjw-portfolio\n\n# Install dependencies\nnpm installDevelopment\nExample :# Start development server\nnpm start\n\n# Application will be available at http://localhost:4200Build\nExample :# Build for production\nnpm run build\n\n# Output will be in dist/moodyjw-portfolioTesting\nExample :# Run unit tests (interactive, watch mode)\nnpm test\n\n# Run unit tests with coverage (used in CI)\nnpm run test:coverage\n\n# Run linting (ESLint + accessibility)\nnpm run lint\n\n# Run E2E tests\nnpm run test:e2e\n\n# Run E2E tests in UI mode (interactive)\nnpm run test:e2e:ui\n\n# Update visual regression baselines\nnpm run test:e2e:update-snapshotsImportant: Always use npm test or npm run test:coverage for running tests. Do not use npx vitest run directly as it bypasses Angular's test infrastructure which handles component template and style resolution.\nStorybook\nExample :# Start Storybook development server\nnpm run storybook\n\n# Build Storybook static site\nnpm run build-storybookNote: The storybook-static/ build output is excluded from git (.gitignore) and CodeQL scanning. This directory contains bundled dependencies and should not be committed to the repository.\nCI/CD Pipeline\nThe project includes 8 automated workflows:\n\nCI (ci.yml) - Build, lint, test with coverage (80% threshold)\nE2E Tests (e2e.yml) - Cross-browser testing (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)\nLighthouse (lighthouse.yml) - Performance monitoring with PR comments\nDependency Review (dependency-review.yml) - Security vulnerability scanning\nDeploy Pages (deploy-pages.yml) - Automated GitHub Pages deployment\nCompodoc (compodoc.yml) - API documentation generation\nDocs Check (docs-check.yml) - Documentation validation\nPages Sanity (pages-sanity.yml) - Deployment verification\n\nAll workflows run on pull requests and must pass before merging.\nSecurity: GitHub's CodeQL \"Default setup\" is enabled for automatic security analysis on every push and PR.\n📐 Architecture Principles\nStandalone Components\nAll components are standalone, eliminating the need for NgModules:\nExample :@Component({\n  selector: 'app-feature',\n  standalone: true,\n  imports: [CommonModule, RouterLink],\n  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,\n})\nexport class FeatureComponent {}Signals\nUsing Angular Signals for reactive state:\nExample :protected readonly data = signal(initialValue);Lazy Loading\nAll feature routes are lazy-loaded:\nExample :{\n  path: 'feature',\n  loadComponent: () => import('./features/feature').then(m => m.FeatureComponent)\n}OnPush Change Detection\nAll components use OnPush strategy for optimal performance:\nExample :changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush;🎯 Code Style\nBEM Naming Convention\nExample :.component {\n  &__element {\n    // element styles\n  }\n\n  &__element--modifier {\n    // modifier styles\n  }\n}CSS Variables Usage\nExample :.component {\n  color: var(--color-primary);\n  padding: var(--spacing-lg);\n  font-size: var(--font-size-base);\n}🧪 Testing Strategy\nUnit Testing\n\nFramework: Vitest\nCoverage: Components, services, utilities\nStrategy: Test signal updates, component reactions, and business logic\n\nE2E Testing\n\nFramework: Playwright\nCoverage: Navigation, user flows, visual regression\nViewports: Desktop (1920x1080), Laptop (1440x1024), Tablet (768x1024), Mobile (375x667)\nBrowsers: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit\n\nVisual Regression Tests\nVisual regression tests ensure CSS Grid layouts and responsive designs don't break:\n\nScreenshots captured for Home and Case Studies pages\nTested across 4 viewports (Desktop, Laptop, Tablet, Mobile)\nBaseline images stored in e2e/screenshots-baseline/\nAutomatic pixel-by-pixel comparison\n\nSee E2E Testing Guide for detailed information.\n📚 Documentation\n\nImplementation Plan - Phased development roadmap\nArchitecture - System architecture and design decisions\nCopilot Instructions - AI coding assistant guidelines\nClaude Code Commands - Claude Code slash commands and configuration\nE2E Testing Guide - Playwright testing documentation\nEnvironment Configuration - Environment setup and configuration\nConstants Documentation - Application constants usage guide\n\nAI Coding Assistants\nThis project is optimized for AI-assisted development:\n\nGitHub Copilot: See .github/copilot-instructions.md for comprehensive coding guidelines\nClaude Code: See .claude/README.md for available slash commands like /new-component, /accessibility-check, /review-pr, and more\n\n🚀 Deployment\nThis project is deployed to GitHub Pages with automated CI/CD via GitHub Actions.\nGitHub Pages Configuration\nCurrent Status: Workflow created and ready. First deployment will occur when configuration is merged to main branch.\nInitial Setup\n\nGo to repository Settings → Pages\nUnder Source, select GitHub Actions\nPush changes to main branch to trigger automatic deployment\n\nAutomated Deployment Workflow\nThe .github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml workflow automatically:\n\nTriggers on every push to main branch\nBuilds the application with production configuration\nApplies the correct baseHref for GitHub Pages (/moodyjw-portfolio/)\nCreates a 404.html for SPA routing support\nUploads and deploys to GitHub Pages\n\nSite URL\nOnce deployed, the site will be available at:\nExample :https://MoodyJW.github.io/moodyjw-portfolio/Note: First deployment is pending merge of configuration to main branch.\nManual Deployment\nTo trigger a deployment manually (without pushing to main):\n\nGo to Actions tab in GitHub\nSelect Deploy to GitHub Pages workflow\nClick Run workflow → Run workflow\n\nLocal Production Build\nTest the production build locally before deploying:\nExample :# Build for production (with GitHub Pages baseHref)\nnpm run build\n\n# Serve the production build locally\nnpx http-server dist/moodyjw-portfolio/browser -p 8080Note: When serving locally, routes may not work exactly as on GitHub Pages due to baseHref differences.\n🤝 Contributing\n\nFollow the established folder structure\nUse standalone components with OnPush\nImplement features with signals\nStyle with BEM and CSS variables\nLazy-load all feature routes\nWrite tests for new functionality\n\n📊 Performance\n\nInitial Bundle: ~60 KB (gzipped)\nLazy Chunks: ~1-1.5 KB each feature\nLighthouse Scores (enforced via CI):\nPerformance: ≥95\nAccessibility: 100\nBest Practices: 100\nSEO: ≥90\n\n\nCore Web Vitals:\nFirst Contentful Paint: \nLargest Contentful Paint: \nCumulative Layout Shift: \nTotal Blocking Time: \nSpeed Index: \n\n\n\n🔐 Security\n\nDependency Review: Automated scanning blocks high-severity vulnerabilities\nCodeQL Analysis: GitHub's built-in security scanning for TypeScript/JavaScript\nLicense Compliance: Copyleft licenses (GPL, LGPL, AGPL) automatically blocked\nBranch Protection: Required status checks enforce all quality gates\nNo Hardcoded Secrets: All sensitive data managed via environment variables\n\n📝 License\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License.\n👤 Author\nMoodyJW\n\nGitHub: @MoodyJW\n\n\nBuilt with ❤️ using Angular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"license - license","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 MoodyJW\nAll rights reserved.\nThis repository and its contents are provided for portfolio and demonstration purposes only.
