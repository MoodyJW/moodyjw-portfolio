standalone). A demonstration of scalable architecture, custom design systems, and high-performance UI patterns.\n\n🚀 Features\n\n✅ Modern Angular 21+ with standalone components\n✅ NgRx SignalStore for reactive state management\n✅ Signals for reactive data flow\n✅ Feature-based architecture (Core, Shared, Features)\n✅ Lazy-loaded routes for optimal performance\n✅ OnPush change detection throughout\n✅ Custom design system with CSS Variables (no UI frameworks)\n✅ BEM methodology for maintainable styles\n✅ Responsive layout with mobile-first approach\n✅ Dark mode support (auto-detects system preference)\n✅ Mockend data layer with simulated network latency for realistic development\n✅ Complete CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions (build, test, E2E, performance, security)\n\n📁 Project Structure\nExample :## 📚 Documentation (Compodoc)\n\nWe use `compodoc` to generate API documentation for the Angular application. Docs are generated into `docs/compodoc`.\n\nGenerate docs locally:\n\n```bash\n# Install dependencies\nnpm install\n\n# Generate Compodoc documentation\nnpx compodoc -p tsconfig.json -d docs/compodoc\n\n# Serve docs locally\nnpx compodoc -s -d docs/compodocCI: A GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/compodoc.yml) is included to generate docs on main and upload them as an artifact.\nPublished docs: The deployment workflow also copies generated Compodoc output into the production dist and deploys it with the site. After a Pages deploy, API docs will be available at:\nExample :https://MoodyJW.github.io/moodyjw-portfolio/docs/compodoc/src/\n├── app/\n│ ├── core/ # Core application functionality\n│ │ ├── layout/ # Shell layouts (MainLayout)\n│ │ ├── services/ # Global services (ProjectService)\n│ │ ├── store/ # NgRx SignalStore (ProjectStore)\n│ │ ├── guards/ # Route guards\n│ │ ├── interceptors/ # HTTP interceptors (latency simulation)\n│ │ └── models/ # Data models and interfaces (Project)\n├── assets/\n│ └── data/ # Mock JSON data files (projects.json)\n├── shared/ # Shared across features\n│ ├── components/ # Reusable components\n│ ├── directives/ # Custom directives\n│ ├── pipes/ # Custom pipes\n│ └── utils/ # Utility functions\n└── features/ # Feature modules\n├── home/ # Home page feature\n└── case-studies/ # Case studies feature\nExample :\n## 🛠️ Tech Stack\n\n- **Framework**: Angular 21.0\n- **Language**: TypeScript 5.9 (strict mode)\n- **Styling**: SCSS with CSS Variables\n- **State Management**: NgRx SignalStore + Angular Signals\n- **Data Layer**: Mockend pattern with local JSON files\n- **HTTP Client**: Angular HttpClient with functional interceptors\n- **Routing**: Angular Router (lazy-loaded)\n- **Testing**: Vitest (Unit) + Playwright (E2E + Visual Regression)\n- **Build Tool**: Angular CLI with Vite\n- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (4 workflows) + GitHub CodeQL\n- **Code Quality**: ESLint with Angular ESLint + accessibility linting\n- **Performance**: Lighthouse CI with strict budgets (≥95/100/100/90)\n\n## 🎨 Design System\n\nThe application uses a custom design system built with CSS Variables for consistency and theme support:\n\n- **Colors**: Primary, surface, text, and status colors\n- **Spacing**: 8-point grid system (xs to 4xl)\n- **Typography**: Font sizes, weights, and families\n- **Border Radius**: Consistent corner radii\n- **Shadows**: Elevation system\n- **Transitions**: Standardized durations and timings\n\nAll design tokens are defined in `src/styles/_variables.scss`.\n\n## 💾 Data Architecture (Mockend Pattern)\n\nThe application uses a **Mockend** approach for data management, providing a realistic development experience that easily transitions to real APIs:\n\n### Architecture Overview\n┌─────────────────┐\n│ Component │\n└────────┬────────┘\n│\n▼\n┌─────────────────┐\n│ ProjectService │ (uses inject(HttpClient))\n└────────┬────────┘\n│\n▼\n┌─────────────────┐\n│ HttpClient │ → latencyInterceptor (500-1000ms delay)\n└────────┬────────┘\n│\n▼\n┌─────────────────┐\n│ projects.json │ (src/assets/data/)\n└─────────────────┘\nExample :\n### Key Components\n\n- **`src/assets/data/projects.json`**: Mock data for case studies/projects\n- **`ProjectService`**: Service layer that fetches data using HttpClient\n- **`latencyInterceptor`**: Functional interceptor that simulates network latency (500-1000ms)\n- **`Project` model**: TypeScript interface defining the data structure\n\n### Why This Approach?\n\n1. **Realistic Development**: Simulated latency helps test loading states and UX\n2. **Easy Transition**: Same service layer works with real APIs—just change the URL\n3. **No Backend Required**: Develop frontend features independently\n4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with defined models\n5. **Testable**: Easy to mock and test data flows\n\n### Usage Example with NgRx SignalStore\n\n```typescript\nimport { Component, inject, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\nimport { ProjectStore } from '@core/store';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-case-studies',\n  standalone: true,\n  template: `\n    @if (store.isLoading()) {\n    Loading projects...\n    } @else if (store.error()) {\n    Error: {{ store.error() }}\n    } @else {\n    Projects ({{ store.projectCount() }})\n    @for (project of store.projects(); track project.id) {\n    {{ project.title }}\n    } }\n  `,\n})\nexport class CaseStudiesComponent implements OnInit {\n  readonly store = inject(ProjectStore);\n\n  ngOnInit() {\n    // Load projects automatically triggers loading state\n    this.store.loadProjects();\n  }\n}🎯 State Management with NgRx SignalStore\nStore Features\nThe ProjectStore provides a complete state management solution:\nState Properties:\n\nprojects() - Array of all projects\nselectedProject() - Currently selected project\nisLoading() - Loading state indicator\nerror() - Error message if any\n\nComputed Selectors:\n\nprojectCount() - Total number of projects\nprojectsByTag(tag) - Filter projects by tag\nhasSelection() - Check if a project is selected\nallTags() - Get all unique tags sorted\n\nMethods:\n\nloadProjects() - Load all projects\nloadProjectById(id) - Load and select specific project\nselectProject(project) - Manually set selected project\nclearSelection() - Clear selected project\nclearError() - Clear error state\nreset() - Reset store to initial state\n\nAdvanced Usage\nExample :// Filter projects by technology\nconst angularProjects = store.projectsByTag()('Angular');\n\n// Check loading state\nif (store.isLoading()) {\n  // Show spinner\n}\n\n// Access all tags for filtering UI\nconst tags = store.allTags(); // ['Angular', 'React', 'TypeScript', ...]🚦 Getting Started\nPrerequisites\n\nNode.js 20.x or higher\nnpm 10.x or higher\n\nInstallation\nExample :# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/MoodyJW/moodyjw-portfolio.git\n\n# Navigate to project directory\ncd moodyjw-portfolio\n\n# Install dependencies\nnpm installDevelopment\nExample :# Start development server\nnpm start\n\n# Application will be available at http://localhost:4200Build\nExample :# Build for production\nnpm run build\n\n# Output will be in dist/moodyjw-portfolioTesting\nExample :# Run unit tests with coverage\nnpm test\n\n# Run linting (ESLint + accessibility)\nnpm run lint\n\n# Run E2E tests\nnpm run test:e2e\n\n# Run E2E tests in UI mode (interactive)\nnpm run test:e2e:ui\n\n# Update visual regression baselines\nnpm run test:e2e:update-snapshotsCI/CD Pipeline\nThe project includes 4 automated workflows:\n\nCI (ci.yml) - Build, lint, test with coverage (80% threshold)\nE2E Tests (e2e.yml) - Cross-browser testing (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)\nLighthouse (lighthouse.yml) - Performance monitoring with PR comments\nDependency Review (dependency-review.yml) - Security vulnerability scanning\n\nAll workflows run on pull requests and must pass before merging.\nSecurity: GitHub's built-in CodeQL scanning is enabled for static code analysis and vulnerability detection.\n📐 Architecture Principles\nStandalone Components\nAll components are standalone, eliminating the need for NgModules:\nExample :@Component({\n  selector: 'app-feature',\n  standalone: true,\n  imports: [CommonModule, RouterLink],\n  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,\n})\nexport class FeatureComponent {}Signals\nUsing Angular Signals for reactive state:\nExample :protected readonly data = signal(initialValue);Lazy Loading\nAll feature routes are lazy-loaded:\nExample :{\n  path: 'feature',\n  loadComponent: () => import('./features/feature').then(m => m.FeatureComponent)\n}OnPush Change Detection\nAll components use OnPush strategy for optimal performance:\nExample :changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush;🎯 Code Style\nBEM Naming Convention\nExample :.component {\n  &__element {\n    // element styles\n  }\n\n  &__element--modifier {\n    // modifier styles\n  }\n}CSS Variables Usage\nExample :.component {\n  color: var(--color-primary);\n  padding: var(--spacing-lg);\n  font-size: var(--font-size-base);\n}🧪 Testing Strategy\nUnit Testing\n\nFramework: Vitest\nCoverage: Components, services, utilities\nStrategy: Test signal updates, component reactions, and business logic\n\nE2E Testing\n\nFramework: Playwright\nCoverage: Navigation, user flows, visual regression\nViewports: Desktop (1920x1080), Laptop (1440x1024), Tablet (768x1024), Mobile (375x667)\nBrowsers: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit\n\nVisual Regression Tests\nVisual regression tests ensure CSS Grid layouts and responsive designs don't break:\n\nScreenshots captured for Home and Case Studies pages\nTested across 4 viewports (Desktop, Laptop, Tablet, Mobile)\nBaseline images stored in e2e/screenshots-baseline/\nAutomatic pixel-by-pixel comparison\n\nSee E2E Testing Guide for detailed information.\n📚 Documentation\n\nImplementation Plan - Phased development roadmap\nCopilot Instructions - AI coding assistant guidelines\nE2E Testing Guide - Playwright testing documentation\nEnvironment Configuration - Environment setup and configuration\nConstants Documentation - Application constants usage guide\n\n🚀 Deployment\nThis project is deployed to GitHub Pages with automated CI/CD via GitHub Actions.\nGitHub Pages Configuration\nCurrent Status: Workflow created and ready.
